Did you face any trouble when you participated any code competition that you were given input files and needed to produce output.
This is easier in Java, python etc. because they can access files directly.
But in js (run in web browser you need a file picker to do that. So dont waste time to build that , here is one for you that suits your task.
Modify it as you need. result will be displayed in console and in text Area at index.html.
